              <h2>Subscription</h2>
              <p>
                1. Your Skript software subscription will continue until
                terminated. To use the Skript service you/your company must have
                Internet access and a ready device, and provide us with one or
                more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means a current, valid,
                accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time,
                and which may include payment through your account with a third
                party. Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date,
                you authorize us to charge the membership fee for the next billing
                cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below). 2. We may
                offer several subscription plans, including subscriptions offered
                by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their
                products and services. We are not responsible for the products and
                services provided by such third parties. Some subscription plans
                may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be
                disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made
                available to you. You can find specific details regarding your
                Skript subscription by visiting the Skript.com website and
                clicking on the "Account" link available at the top of the pages
                under your profile name.

              <h2>Billing and Cancellation</h2>
              <p>
                1. Billing Cycle. The Subscription fee for the Skript service and
                any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the
                service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be
                charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date
                indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle
                will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you
                signed up for the service. In some cases, your payment date may
                change, for example, if your Payment Method has not successfully
                settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid
                membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit
                the Skript.com website and click on the "Billing details" link on
                the "Account" page to see your next payment date. We may authorize
                your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or
                service-related charges through various methods, including
                authorizing it for up to approximately one month of service as
                soon as you register. If you signed up for Enineering360 using
                your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find
                the billing information about your Skript subscription by visiting
                your account with the applicable third party. <br />
                2. Payment Methods.
                To use the Skript service you must provide one or more Payment
                Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated
                with your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined
                or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee.
                You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If payment is
                not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds,
                or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend
                your access to the service until we have successfully charged a
                valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may
                charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other
                fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax
                charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with
                your Payment Method service provider for details. <br />
                3. Updating your
                Payment Methods. You can update your Payment Methods by going to
                the "Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using
                the information provided by the payment service providers.
                Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the
                applicable Payment Method(s). <br />
                4. Cancellation. You can cancel your
                Skript subscription at any time, and you will continue to have
                access to the Skript service through the end of your billing
                period. To the extent permitted by the applicable law, payments
                are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for
                any partial membership periods or unused Skript content. To
                cancel, go to the "Account" page and follow the instructions for
                cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will
                automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To
                see when your account will close, click "Billing details" on the
                "Account" page. If you signed up for Skript using your account
                with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your
                Skript subscription, you may need to do so through such a third
                party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable
                third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the
                Skript service through that third party. <br />
                4.5. Changes to the Price
                and Subscription Plans. We may change our subscription plans and
                the price of our service from time to time; however, any price
                changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply no
                earlier than 30 days following notice to you.

                is charged (the "Account Owner") is responsible for any activity
                that occurs through the Skript account. To maintain control over
                the account and to prevent anyone from accessing the account
                (which would include information on the viewing history for the
                account), the Account Owner should maintain control over the
                Skript-ready devices that are used to access the service and not
                reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated
                with the account to anyone. You are responsible for updating and
                maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide to us

                identity theft or other fraudulent activity.
