      <h1>Make decisions in a flash</h1>
      <p>
        Our assessment tests give engineers and their managers a clear glimpse
        of where they are and what they need to move to the next level of
        growth. No <br /> longer do managers need to excessively make use of
        limited time to make important decisions and with a clear overview of
        the teamâ€™s abilities, <br /> engineering management decisions can be
        made faster.
